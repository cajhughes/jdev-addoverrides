# How to Use the extension

Following successful installation, and re-start of JDeveloper, the extension can be invoked via:

  * Selecting Source -> Add @Override(s) in the top-level menu
  * Clicking the button in the code editor toolbar
  * Selecting the context menu (right-click or CTRL-click) within the Code Editor
  * Using the keyboard shortcut (initially assigned to Alt-O)

*Please note that, in order for the _Add @Override(s)_ option to be enabled, the Java source file being edited must be part of the active Project; otherwise the class cannot be analyzed.*
